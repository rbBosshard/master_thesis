  # The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. The more generic F_beta score applies additional weights, valuing one of precision or recall more than the other.
  beta: 1 # F-beta = (1 + beta^2) * (precision * recall) / ((beta^2 * precision) + recall),  1 = F1, Two commonly used values for beta are 2, which weighs recall higher than precision, and 0.5, which weighs recall lower than precision.

# Todo:
# compare with other assay, which chemicals are easy/difficult to predict
# put assay endpoint together with same mechanistic target
# also try edge case assay and try to tune
