  abstract = { Nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry screening (NTS HRMS/MS) can detect thousands of organic substances in environmental samples. However, new strategies are needed to focus time-intensive identification efforts on features with the highest potential to cause adverse effects instead of the most abundant ones. To address this challenge, we developed MLinvitroTox, a machine learning framework that uses molecular fingerprints derived from fragmentation spectra (MS2) for a rapid classification of thousands of unidentified HRMS/MS features as toxic/nontoxic based on nearly 400 target-specific and over 100 cytotoxic endpoints from ToxCast/Tox21. Model development results demonstrated that using customized molecular fingerprints and models, over a quarter of toxic endpoints and the majority of the associated mechanistic targets could be accurately predicted with sensitivities exceeding 0.95. Notably, SIRIUS molecular fingerprints and xboost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) models with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for handling data imbalance were a universally successful and robust modeling configuration. Validation of MLinvitroTox on MassBank spectra showed that toxicity could be predicted from molecular fingerprints derived from MS2 with an average balanced accuracy of 0.75. By applying MLinvitroTox to environmental HRMS/MS data, we confirmed the experimental results obtained with target analysis and narrowed the analytical focus from tens of thousands of detected signals to 783 features linked to potential toxicity, including 109 spectral matches and 30 compounds with confirmed toxic activity.}

    abstract = "{The first edition of Bioanalytical Tools in Water Quality Assessment was released in 2012. The field has exploded since and the second edition updates and reviews the application of bioanalytical tools for water quality assessment including surveillance monitoring. The book focuses on applications to water quality assessment ranging from wastewater to drinking water, including recycled water, as well as treatment processes and advanced water treatment. Emerging applications for other environmental matrices are also included. Bioanalytical Tools in Water Quality Assessment, Second Edition, not only demonstrates applications but also fills in the background knowledge in toxicology/ecotoxicology needed to appreciate these applications. Each chapter summarises fundamental material in a targeted way so that information can be applied to better understand the use of bioanalytical tools in water quality assessment.The book can be used by lecturers teaching academic and professional courses and also by risk assessors, regulators, experts, consultants, researchers and managers working in the water sector. It can also be a reference manual for environmental engineers, analytical chemists and toxicologists.Detailed descriptions of dose-response assessment, data reporting, mixture modelling and quality assurance/quality control are complemented by a series of online resources and tools to apply some of the principles and data methods explained in this book.

ABSTRACT={Humans are exposed to large numbers of chemicals during their daily activities. To assess and understand potential health impacts of chemical exposure, investigators and regulators need access to reliable toxicity data. In particular, reliable toxicity data for a wide range of chemistries are needed to support development of new approach methodologies (NAMs) such as computational models, which offer increased throughput relative to traditional approaches and reduce or replace animal use. NAMs development and evaluation require chemically diverse data sets that are typically constructed by incorporating results from multiple studies into a single, integrated view; however, integrating data is not always a straightforward task. Primary study sources often vary in the way data are organized and reported. Metadata and information needed to support interoperability and provide context are often lacking, which necessitates literature research on the assay prior to attempting data integration. The Integrated Chemical Environment (ICE) was developed to support the development, evaluation, and application of NAMs. ICE provides curated toxicity data and computational tools to integrate and explore available information, thus facilitating knowledge discovery and interoperability. This paper describes the data curation workflow for integrating data into ICE. Data destined for ICE undergo rigorous harmonization, standardization, and formatting processes using both automated and manual expert-driven approaches. These processes improve the utility of the data for diverse analyses and facilitate application within ICE or a user’s external workflow while preserving data integrity and context. ICE data curation provides the structure, reliability, and accessibility needed for data to support chemical assessments.}

	abstract = {A central assumption of all machine learning is that the training data are an informative subset of the true distribution we want to learn. Yet, this assumption may be violated in practice. Recently, learning from the molecular structures of small molecules has moved into the focus of the machine learning community. Usually, those small molecules are of biological interest, such as metabolites or drugs. Applications include prediction of toxicity, ligand binding or retention time.We investigate how well certain large-scale datasets cover the space of all known biomolecular structures. Investigation of coverage requires a sensible distance measure between molecular structures. We use a well-known distance measure based on solving the Maximum Common Edge Subgraph (MCES) problem, which agrees well with the chemical and biochemical intuition of similarity between compounds. Unfortunately, this computational problem is NP-hard, severely restricting the use of the corresponding distance measure in large-scale studies. We introduce an exact approach that combines Integer Linear Programming and intricate heuristic bounds to ensure efficient computations and dependable results.We find that several large-scale datasets frequently used in this domain of machine learning are far from a uniform coverage of known biomolecular structures. This severely confines the predictive power of models trained on this data. Next, we propose two further approaches to check if a training dataset differs substantially from the distribution of known biomolecular structures. On the positive side, our methods may allow creators of large-scale datasets to identify regions in molecular structure space where it is advisable to provide additional training data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

% Find literature at Google Scholar, then click cite link below and choose BibTeX. When you copy it here, check if title capitalization works as intended. If there are abbreviations, names, or any other text that needs to stay capitalized, put it in {}. For example:
% title={Usage of JavaScript and Other Programming Languages in Switzerland}
% Would be printed as: "Usage of javascript and other programming languages in switzerland," to fix it, use:
% title={Usage of {JavaScript} and Other Programming Languages in {Switzerland}}
% Which will print it as "Usage of JavaScript and other programming languages in Switzerland," which is the correct capitalization in references.
