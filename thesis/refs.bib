The novel dose-response modeling algorithm has been tested against millions of diverse dose-response series, and robustly fits data with outliers and cytotoxicity-related signal loss.tcpl is freely available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network under the GPL-2 license.}",

% Find literature at Google Scholar, then click cite link below and choose BibTeX. When you copy it here, check if title capitalization works as intended. If there are abbreviations, names, or any other text that needs to stay capitalized, put it in {}. For example:
% title={Usage of JavaScript and Other Programming Languages in Switzerland}
% Would be printed as: "Usage of javascript and other programming languages in switzerland," to fix it, use:
% title={Usage of {JavaScript} and Other Programming Languages in {Switzerland}}
% Which will print it as "Usage of JavaScript and other programming languages in Switzerland," which is the correct capitalization in references.
