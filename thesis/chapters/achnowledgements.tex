\begin{abstract}
	First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Fernando Perez-Cruz from the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC) for granting me the opportunity to work
	on this fascinating project. His support has been invaluable.

	I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Dr.\ Kasia Arturi from Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) and my supervisors Dr.\ Eliza Harris, Lili Gasser from SDSC for their  numerous discussions, patience and valuable insights. Without their help, this thesis would not have been achievable.

    Additionally, I would like to acknowledge Prof.\ Dr.\ Juliane Hollender from Eawag for her support throughout the project and  for the enlightening experience of visiting the Eawag labs.

    Furthermore, my gratitude goes out to Jason Brown, Feshuk Madison, and Katie Paul Friedman for their participation in discussions concerning the technical aspects of the tcpl pipeline and the ToxCast database.
	
    Lastly, I extend a special thank you to my family and friends for their unconditional support throughout my academic journey.
