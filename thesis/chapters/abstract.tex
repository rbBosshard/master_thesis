  This thesis enhances the capabilities of the MLinvitroTox framework, which is designed to forecast the toxicity of unidentified chemical compounds utilizing High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS/MS) data. The framework forecasts the most hazardous compounds within environmental samples, channeling resources and efforts into the labor-intensive task of identifying and quantifying compounds with the highest potential for causing harm. This approach stands in contrast to standard nontarget screening HRMS workflows, which typically prioritize compounds that are detected most frequently and with highest intensities. We employed hazard-driven machine learning models based on molecular fingerprints derived from chemical structure and utilized \emph{in vitro} toxicity data from ToxCast/Tox21. We have developed \texttt{pytcpl}, a \texttt{Python}-based processing pipeline that is applicable to the latest toxicity data. We have leveraged datasets spanning various assay endpoints that encompass a wide range of toxicity aspects. The individual machine learning models achieve an average balanced accuracy of 0.6 when predicting binary toxicity based on molecular fingerprints from known chemical structures. The models also demonstrate effectiveness in predictivity when validated on SIRIUS predicted molecular fingerprints from MassBank spectra. Furthermore, a user-friendly web app was created to facilitate interaction with the data and the MLinvitroTox framework.
