  This thesis enhances the MLinvitroTox framework, which predicts the toxicity of unknown compounds from HRMS/MS data. This framework can forecast the most hazardous compounds in environmental samples, circumventing the need for resource-intensive chemical identification. It uses machine learning models trained on ToxCast/Tox21 in vitro data and SIRIUS molecular fingerprints. We implemented a new processing pipeline called pytcpl and expanded its application to the latest toxicity data, achieving an average balanced accuracy of todo:X for binarized toxicity prediction. MLinvitroTox was also effective when validated with MassBank spectra data. Additionally, we developed a web app for user-friendly interaction with the framework.
