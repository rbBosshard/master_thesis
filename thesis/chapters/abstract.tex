  MLinvitroTox employs hazard-driven prioritization to rapidly rank compounds based on their predicted toxicities in specific endpoints, thus circumventing the resource-intensive process of chemical compound identification within complex environmental samples.. 
  % The use of SIRIUS molecular fingerprints and xgboost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) models, complemented by feature selection, has yielded consistently successful results. Furthermore, we have validated the effectiveness of MLinvitroTox by applying it to MassBank spectra, demonstrating an average balanced accuracy of X in predicting toxicity.
