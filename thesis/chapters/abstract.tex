  This thesis enhances the MLinvitroTox framework, which predicts the toxicity of unknown chemical compounds from High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS/MS) data. The framework forecasts the most hazardous compounds in environmental samples, circumventing the need for resource-intensive analytical identification of chemicals. The machine learning models are trained on molecular fingerprints derived from chemical structure and utilized \emph{in vitro} toxicity data from ToxCast/Tox21. We have developed pytcpl, a Python-based processing pipeline that is applicable to the latest toxicity data. We have leveraged datasets spanning various assay endpoints that encompass a wide range of toxicity aspects. The individual machine learning models achieve an average balanced accuracy of todo:X when predicting binary toxicity based on molecular fingerprints from known chemical structures. The models also demonstrate effectiveness in predictivity when validated on SIRIUS predicted molecular fingerprints from MassBank spectra. Furthermore, a user-friendly web app was created to facilitate interaction with the data and the MLinvitroTox framework.
