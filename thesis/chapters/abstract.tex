  This thesis enhances the MLinvitroTox framework, which predicts the toxicity of unknown chemical compounds from High-Resolution Mass-Spectrometry (HRMS/MS) fragmentation spectra data. This framework forecasts the most hazardous compounds in environmental samples, circumventing the need for resource-intensive analytical chemical identification. The predictivity is evaluated on SIRIUS molecular fingerprints from MassBank spectra data. However, the machine learning models are trained on molecular fingerprints derived from chemical structure and utilized in vitro toxicity data from ToxCast/Tox21. We have developed pytcpl, a Python-based processing pipeline that extends its applicability to the latest toxicity data. We have leveraged datasets spanning various assay endpoints that encompass a wide range of toxicity aspects. The individual machine learning models achieve an average balanced accuracy of todo:X when predicting binary toxicity and demonstrate effectiveness when validated using MassBank spectra data. Furthermore, a user-friendly web app was created to facilitate interaction with this framework.
